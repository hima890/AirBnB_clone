Here are some examples of well-named branches following these practices:

feature/user-authentication
bugfix/issue-123
hotfix/production-crash
refactor/database-schema
release/version-1.0
experiment/new-ui-design

By following these practices, you can create branch names
that are meaningful, easy to understand, and help streamline
collaboration within your team.
