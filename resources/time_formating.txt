%Y: Year with century as a decimal number (e.g., 2024).
%y: Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 99).
%m: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 12).
%B: Full month name (e.g., January).
%b or %h: Abbreviated month name (e.g., Jan).
%d: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 31).
%A: Full weekday name (e.g., Monday).
%a: Abbreviated weekday name (e.g., Mon).
%H: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 23).
%I: Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 12).
%p: AM or PM designation.
%M: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 59).
%S: Second as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 59).
%f: Microsecond as a zero-padded decimal number (000000 to 999999).
%z: UTC offset in the form Â±HHMM[SS[.ffffff]] (empty string if the object is naive).

%j: Day of the year as a zero-padded decimal number (001 to 366).
%U: Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as

%W: Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as 
    a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 53). All days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0.
